// Sort an array
    // PART 1
        // Given an array, such as [1, 4, 2, 5, 3]
        // Write a program that will display the sorted array from smallest to largest
        // There are many ways to do this that we will talk about, but for now
        // use a "Selection Sort".

        // A selection sort is a sorting algorithm where the program iterates over the
        // array and "selects" the smallest element and places it at the end of a new array,
        // and then the next smallest, and so on. The program continues doing this until it 
        // has sorted the whole array.

    // PART 2
        // After you have accomplished this, try and solve the problem again but "In Place".
        // An "In Place" sorting algorithm sorts an array without using a second array in
        // the process. It only uses the original array.

let unsorted = [1, 4, 2, 5, 3];
let sorted = [];
